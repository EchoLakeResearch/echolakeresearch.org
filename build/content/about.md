# About

Our mission is to help people in our local community find better food, stronger community, and more resilient living by connecting together, and by connecting to this place we call home.

## Our Story

Echo Lake Research started in 2017 as a small market garden, and quickly transformed into a broader community development effort. It is a project mostly of Jason Padvorac, with support from Meggan Padvorac and our two daughters. We are located near Maltby, Washington, and are working to strengthen and localize the community in our neighborhood.

Jason grew up with an organic vegetable garden in the backyard, and always loved exploring in the wilderness. Wanting to use his fascination with living systems to serve humanity, he earned a BS in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Washington. He gradually realized that the most accessible wins for human health and happiness were not in advanced medical research, but in simple changes of life practice. Time spent with indigenous Karen people in Thailand was a transformative experience that helped him see how much richer community should be than we are used to here.

While paying the bills as a web developer, he has used his scientific and engineering skills in searching out the most practical, impactful ways that we can retrofit our modern lives, right here and now. A major source of inspiration and useful tools have come from the worlds of Natural Farming, Permaculture Design, and other regenerative frameworks.

We don’t need to wait for politicians to change national policies, we don’t need to wait for corporations to develop products, and we don’t need to wait for universities to perform the research we need. There are practical steps driven by modern science and traditional knowledge that let us build healthier, happier, fuller lives for our families right now. There are simple questions we can seek out and answer as a community, right now. Let's get to it!

## Guiding Principles

1. Community first, and whenever possible involve food and health.
   We need each other, and the most impactful changes will stem from us living that out. Some of the most impactful changes we can support each other in making relate to how we eat and how we stay healthy.
2. Choose local
   This is an incredibly simple but effective rule for making decisions that are socially, economically, and environmentally optimal. Something that comes from the front porch is better than front yard, which is better than down the road, which is better than in the same town, which is better than same region.
3. Be positive
   We won’t get anywhere unless we focus on where we need to go. With our eyes wide open to challenges, we can still look to the horizon and build a more beautiful world.
4. Free up time, energy, and money
   As much as possible, we try to help with all three at the same time. The aim here is to live better, and we need to have room to breathe for that!

## How it looks in practice

To get an idea of how we can make this work, lets take a walk in the kitchen garden…

We teach people how to grow a vegetable garden with no weeding, no double digging, no pesticides or fertilizers, and much less watering than a normal garden. Compared to a conventional garden, this is a piece of cake! You plant once in early spring, and after that your only work is to harvest fresh food. There is no buying anything, except maybe some seeds! So you save time and money, while having food that is fresher, tastier, and more nutrient dense than anything you can buy. This example obviously hits the target of “having incredible food”.

Recent studies have made it clear that the more veggies we eat, the healthier we are. There is no upper limit! If we easily grow veggies that are more affordable, better tasting, and more nutritious to boot? That is a huge win for our personal health.

And saving the most important for last – community! Having a garden provides almost limitless leverage points for building community. You can knock on a neighbor’s door to share extra produce or seeds you’ve saved yourself. You can invite people over to help cook a meal straight from the garden. Even the simple act of being outside makes encounters with neighbors a lot more common.

The interconnections are deeper than that, though! All of this circles around the fulfilling lives we are meant to have, and as we get closer in one way it helps us get closer all around.

Loneliness is an epidemic. That is not a metaphor – our physical and mental health both get hit hard when we are not living in vibrant community with each other. Being in community helps us be literally healthier. The healthier we are, the easier it is to find the internal energy to try new things and make changes in our lives, like growing a new kind of garden and eating fresh food from it. Which also helps us to be more healthy, which makes it easier to connect with community.

There are many, many ways that deeply local living can have an impact on our lives. Mealkit parties, where people buy food in bulk and assemble their own mealkits to save money and time while finding new friends. Practicing scientifically validated herbal medicine, like using extremely simple techniques to grow elderberry bushes and make flu medicine. Creating simple routines for foraging walks gives has benefits for mental health, physical health, provides nutritious food for free, and gives even more opportunities for connection. And on and on.
