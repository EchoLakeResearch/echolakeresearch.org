## Vegetables

## Fruit

Nothing is quite like a Washington apple picked from a storied neighborhood tree, and we are working to preserve and share the oldest ones in our area. You can get involved by connecting us with old trees, coming to a grafting event, and growing local heritage fruit trees!

## Staples

We are collecting, growing and breeding some of the very toughest staple crops that exist for our region. From pest resistant potatoes to drought tolerant corn, and from perennial grains to uncommon staples like sunroots.

## Highly Experimental

Cassava, moringa, prickly pear
