These classes and workshops are designed to make an immediate impact in your life. |      | Elderberries are one of the most important medicinal plants we can grow. They are attested to by modern science and thousands of years of tradition. We are on a mission to organize planting them by the thousands, using them as a stepping stone to transform the health of our families and communities. |

| We are developing simple resources for a grassroots program to help you vitalize your community, starting with simple and rewarding steps in your own neighborhood. We can rediscover the tight-knit communities that we are made for. |      | Nothing is quite like a Washington apple picked from a storied neighborhood tree, and we are working to preserve and share the oldest ones in our area. You can get involved by connecting us with old trees, coming to a grafting event, and growing local heritage fruit trees! |

| We are collecting, growing and breeding some of the very toughest staple crops that exist for our region. From pest resistant potatoes to drought tolerant corn, and from perennial grains to uncommon staples like sunroots. |      | Agroforestry is managing forest land to produce food, medicine, and other high value products in addition to lumber. We want to meet landowners with acreage in or near the Echo Lake area who are interested in exploring in agroforestry work with us.
