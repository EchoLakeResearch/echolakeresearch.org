# People Care

One of the three core ethics of the permaculture design framework is "care of people". This simple checklist can be used in the course of a design process to try to build as accessible and caring of programs as possible with the resources we have available.

1. Motivation
  Is the program being driven by your goals, or by goals coming from the community, or ideally both? There should be alignment here of seeking work you are capable of and passionate about that is wanted by the community. Sometimes this may mean doing work that doesn't fly under the flag "permaculture", if the community isn't interested in it.
2. Bubbles
  Do the organizers and teachers all fit in one bubble, and is your outreach only going around in that bubble? That lack of diversely representative voices will make it hard or impossible to avoid excluding groups of people.
3. Money
  While providing sufficient yield to permaculture workers, programs should be budgeted and designed up front to allow access to people who can afford little or no monetary payment.
4. Transportation
  Some people will use alternatives to cars. Can they get there? If not, can the venue move or transportation be facilitated somehow?
5. Mobility
  Not everyone can walk, or walk well, or bend over, etc. Find ways for them to be involved in physical activities along with others.
6. Timing
  Are there times available for people who don't work M-F 9-5? Can timing be made flexible, or varied? How can people participate who have very little time available?
7. Children
  How do you make children welcome, or how do you structure the program so that parents can most easily and affordably access childcare?
8. Technology
  Can people participate without a computer? A phone? Facebook? Email?
9. Sight and Sound
  How can people with difficulty seeing or hearing participate?
10. Welcome & Listening
  How do you effectively communicate that anyone and everyone will be listened to cared for so that people in oppressed or marginalized groups know they will warmly welcomed and safe?
11. Food
   Food insecurity can be a barrier to participation, so is it possible to incorporate refreshments / snacks / snackluck / potluck / a meal etc into your program? Maybe something prepared for people to take home if the program interfered with their ability to prep a meal?
12. Partnership
   Are there organizations who you could partner with to increase access to your programs? What about contributing components or elements to programs run by others?
