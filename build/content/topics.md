Gardening

- Design with nature
- Kitchen gardening: ianto evans, fencing, tomatoes cukes etc. Total control except for some element of chance in arrangements.
- Open orchard: widely spaced and guilded and maintained trees. Firm suggestions.
- Forageland: wild land that we make gentle suggestions to
- Seed saving (i.e. plant breeding)
- Perennial propagation

Cooking

- Use patterns, not recipes
- Good food uses fresh and diverse ingredients, and mise en place is important to not be overwhelmed
- Pattern recipes: grain bowls, soup and dumplings, porridge, sandwhiches, baked flatbreads, salads, curry

Health

- herbs: help us alleviate symptoms while seeking and remedying underlying causes in diet or lifestyle
- fasts: water fast, potato hack, keto diet, juice fast
- breathing: wim hof, belly breathing, kriya yoga
- nutrition: hand processed, locally growable, picture of quantities for a day
- sleep: good to have, in enough quantity! Light, reading, stress, etc.
- mental, spiritual, emotional: goes hand in hand with physical health. Largest threat is addiction that masks deficits. Addictions to STIMULATION, and secondarily food, alcohol, drugs, etc.
- digestion: bitters & chewing. https://nutritionstudies.org/time-chew-digestive-system-starts-mouth/
- movement + posture

Community

- Front yard garden
- Coffee/Tea culture
- Buy nothing
- Gift economics: based on PERSONAL relationships, not anonymous, and is hardwired into the human brain. We don't have to plan or tell about it, just start doing it.
- children: integrate children whenever possible!

Crops

- List of all the crops. Yay!
